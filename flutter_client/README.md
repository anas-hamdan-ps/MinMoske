3. Select **Location**
4. Set custom location to Stockholm coordinates
5. The app will detect this location for nearby search

## App Usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No pubspec.yaml found"**
   - Make sure you're in the `flutter_client` directory
   - Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

2. **Location not working**
   - Check device permissions
   - For simulators, set custom location as described above
   - Ensure location services are enabled

3. **API connection errors**
   - Verify `config.dart` has correct API URL
   - Check if backend is running/deployed
   - Test API directly with curl

4. **Emulator not found**
   - Install Android Studio for Android emulators
   - Install Xcode for iOS simulators
   - Create emulators using the commands above
